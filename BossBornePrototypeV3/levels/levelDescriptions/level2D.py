elevatorDescription = ("After a slow little wait in the mouldy, brown box, the elevator music I've been enjoying subsides and, in its place, a happy little chirp follows."
"I'm one level closer. The steel doors slowly creak open on the north side of the elevator. "
"\nA fresh scent of old coffee and newspaper hits my nostrils. Followed by the sight of the familar brown boxes, "
"with pinboards on the walls, old computers running noisily and paper scattered all over the floor. "
"It seems to be deserted.\nAs I get out of the elevator, the upbeat music begins again and the doors slide shut. "
"Theres no going back now, the elevator has already been called.")

# CUBICLE 1

cubicle1Description = ("Looking around the cubical I stand in, I can feel the general sense of depression in the air. "
                       "The workers must not have been gone for long. A desk sits on the north side of the office, scattered with various items, and a chair sits behind it. "
                       "On the wall are pictures of one particular employees child. A pinboard with notes of work sits on the east wall to the desk."
                       "\nA small hole, which could barely be classified as a door, sits on the east side of the room, tucked away into a corner, "
                       "granting access to what looks like another cubicle. Looking much more like a doorway, "
                       "another hole stands on the west side of the room, opening up to the kitchen."
                       "\nAfter I take in my surroundings, I'm reminded of the objective. Get to the top. Just, how do I get out of here first..?")

stickyNoteLongDescription = ("An old, fading sticky note. "
                             "It seems to mentions the old vent system, which apparently provides cool air to the whole floor...")
stickyNoteShortDescription = ("As I look at the pinboard, a specific red pin paired with a yellow sticky note catches my eye.")

computerCaseLongDescription = ("It looks like a normal computer case, but upon closer inspection, it seems that the disk port has been forced in.")
computerCaseShortDescription = ("Elsewhere in the room, the computer buzzes under the desk.")

# CUBICLE 2

cubicle2Description = ("Another cubical that looks exactly like every other one in the office stands before me. "
                       "On the west wall, another desk. On the north wall, another pinboard sits next to the desk, "
                       "this time with less appealing information.\n"
                       "One exit is in a similar style to the other cubicals, a mere slit in the south wall. "
                       "Directly opposite from it, in the north wall, sits a much more doorway like shape, leading out into a kitchen.\n"
                       "I guess we follow the trail... Maybe it will lead to a way out?")

screwdriverLongDescription = ("The screwdriver is a standard, Phillips screwdriver, complete with a yellow handle and a long stainless steel head. "
                              "It looks new and ready to go.")
screwdriverShortDescription = ("Sitting on the desk, it looks like someone has tried to open a phone. "
                               "It's not the phone that interests me, however, but the fact that they tried to do it with a screwdriver. "
                               "Maybe it could be useful..?")

# CUBICLE 3

cubicle3Description = ("A standard cubicle. Actually, one of the nicer ones I've seen in this building. "
                       "The chair is parked up under the desk, the computer is turned off, "
                       "papers stacked nearly in little trays on the desk marked 'In' and 'Out'. "
                       "The office looks like a true cubicle, something straight out of a movie.\n"
                       "Even the slits in the north and east wall look a little tidier from this side.\n"
                       "There is nothing sitting on a desk that I can touch. This office is so clean, I wouldn't be too offended to be told to eat off of the floor.")

# CUBICLE 4

cubicle4Description = ("I walk into another cubical. This time, the desk is sitting along the south wall. "
                       "The room is filled with unusually humming noises, apparently coming from the desk. "
                       "Also, unlike other rooms, this room seems to lack an office chair, a pinboard and any photos. "
                       "The only thing in the room is the desk!\n!"
                       "Differing from other cubicles, this one only boasts one slit, in its west wall. "
                       "The east wall actually harbours a door, standing menacingly with a note attached. "
                       "'Old stairwell closed. Permanently.'")

electricalBoxLongDescription = ("The box has a small little key hole on one side. If only I could open this with a small little key, "
                                "I might be able to play with the wires a little.")
electricalBoxShortDescription = ("Under the desk, the source of the humming becomes clear. A box with a yellow lightning strike on it can only indicate one thing; Electricity.")

# CUBICLE 5

cubicle5Description = ("Sitting on the east wall is a desk, office chair sitting right under it and "
                       "an older monitor screen running smoothly on it. "
                       "As I look down at one of the papers scattered across this desk, "
                       "it comes to my attention that they seem to be much more scattered across the room than standard for one of these cubicles. "
                       "They are in all of the corners, and continually flutter.\n"
                       "Unlike other cubicles, there is only one exit to this one. A small slit sits in the north wall.\n"
                       "Surely this is isn't a dead end, right?")

ventScreenLongDescription = ("The vent screen seems old and easy enough to move. I just need to undo those last two screws...")

ventScreenShortDescription = ("Sitting just above the desk comes the source of the wind; A vent. "
                              "As I look inside it, I can just bearly see down to the end of it. "
                              "Any hopes of getting in are blocked by the vent cover, although, it is already missing a screw or two.")

# CUBICLE 6

cubicle6Description = ("Another cubical. Sitting along the east wall is a desk, papers everywhere, and some more, "
                       "nonchalant photos pinned up against a pinboard, just to the left of the desk. "
                       "An office chair sits on one side of the room, "
                       "looking as if someone had spent their moments before their lunch break flying around the room on their chair.\n"
                       "On the east wall sits one standard slit in the wall, and heading south another one, leading to yet another cubicle.\n"
                       "As I head further south east, I feel a freeze come up my spine, as if I'm getting closer to a very cold office.")

# KITCHEN

kitchenDescription = ("Walking into the kitchen, familar black and white tiles layer the ground. "
                      "Looking up, a row of benches, complete with their overhanging cupboards, run along the north and west wall. "
                      "I look around to the 6 employees standing almost aimlessly around the kitchen, "
                      "trying to listen in to a conversation but only hear the indistinct sounds of light chatter.\n"
                      "A door stands on the east side of the room, a hole straight back into a cubicle. "
                      "On the south side stands a small slit in the wall, big enough for a human to pass through, "
                      "that gives entry to yet another cubicle.")

coffeeLongDescription = ("Steam seems to be radiating out of the cup, warning off potential drinkers. "
                         "It could be used to burn something... or maybe short-circuiting is the way to go?")
coffeeShortDescription = ("On the bench is a cup of coffee, that noone seems to have claimed. ")
                          
# VENTS

ventsDescription = ("The further down I get, the colder it gets. "
                   "At this point I'm thinking that I probably should have brought another jacket or two. "
                   "Just as it gets to a point where I can barely stand it anymore, "
                   "an unmistakeably massive vent fan stands looming over me. "
                   "That isn't saying much, as I'm on my hands and knees and the moment, "
                   "but the fan still looks rather intimidating in the dim light.\n"
                   "The only exit is either through the fan, blocking the south corridor, "
                   "or through the broken vent eastward. And I don't think I'm taking the fan option...\n"
                   "There is nothing here I can grab without getting my hands taken off. "
                   "Seriously, who doesn't include an emergency stop button right here?\n"
                   "Surely there must be some way to get past this fan. "
                   "Perhaps an eletrical box that controls the fan should lie somewhere around one of the offices.")

# STAIRWELL

stairwellDescription = ("The closed up stairwell. I can see why it was closed. The carpet on the landing, "
                        "halfway up the stairs, seems to be torn out and never repaired. "
                        "The paint on the walls is slowly peeling, making the place look like a deserted horror house. "
                        "As I slowly move into the landing, I can see that one or two stairs look like they might be missing.\n"
                        "There's only one way out from here, as the vent is too high up to jump back in to. I've got to go up.\n"
                        "There is nothing on the floor I can grab here, although maybe I can play with the peeling paint? "
                        "What fun would that be.\nLets get out of this room and go meet that boss.")
